# Introduction - Results Folder
This directory contains results generated from the example jupyter notebook. Results are of two types and hence are sorted in two sub-directories:
* images - all resulting, final output images ing .png format.
* locations - .csv-files which contain information about trip length for a specific start point. The start point can be derived from the file name, i.e. `<longitude>_<latitude>.csv`.
